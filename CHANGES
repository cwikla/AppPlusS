Added SubPlusS.[ch] for popup/menu shells.
Got rid of extraneous variables

Added <Xm/Xm.h> for -DMOTIF so that XmREVISON would exist!


Fixed check if there is a good default depth and the visualClass
is not set, it would try to match a visual class of -1.


Fixed SubPlus.c XtPlusCreatePopup[Shell/Menu] where I was
accessing the wrong indexes of the incoming Args.

Finally!!!! DirectColor is now correct!!!! I was
not using the CLUT like I should have been (what was
I thinking?)

of colors if possible.

Fri Oct 27 14:18:19 CDT 1995

Fixed a problem where a standard colormap could exist, the visual id
could be right, but a colormap already exists that is NOT the default.

Wed Nov 29 16:19:16 CST 1995

Fixed a == NULL to != NULL, that was keeping the AppPlusS from finding
the deepest depth visual.


Fri Apr 19 10:57:45 CDT 1996

Bugs fixed from bsletten@autometric.com reports:

Now send passed in args for SubPlusS.c to both MenuShell and RowColumn.
This was making tear-off-menus not work.

Made the XCC not do a queryColors malloc if the depth > 12. This could happen
apparantly on a TrueColor/DirectColor visual which is bad.

Fri Apr 19 11:56:09 CDT 1996

Arg. Real fix for SubPlusS.c...

Sun Apr 21 11:52:35 CDT 1996

Subtracted 1 for number of args when concatanating args passes in.
Removed XmNborderColor and XmNbackgroundColor settings.
